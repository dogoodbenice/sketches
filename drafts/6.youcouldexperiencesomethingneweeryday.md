#### Reflecting on barriers for experiencing new things and what that could mean for creators.

It might be safe to say that starting today, you could experience *something* new everyday.

New art, new music, new foods even new people. Even better, the vast majority of this is *relatively* for free. Right now there are millions of new things coming into being, all ready for us to experience.

Despite this apparent abundance, I'd put forward a guess that over 95% of these new things will never be seen or even sought after. Why aren't the majority of people actively mining these new threads of things?

Like a drop in the ocean these new things sprout from.

> You may have come to the same conclusion as me that people are seldom ready for new things.

#### High expectations 

#### Want of stability to know what will happen

#### Worry of wasting time
This on items of low quality

#### Mistrust in the thing
For a completely

#### It's too hard to understand

#### There are better things out there

When it comes to trying new products and services, it's natural for people to feel hesitant. After all, nobody wants to waste their time or money on something that doesn't work or meet their expectations. This hesitation can be especially strong when it comes to products and services that are significantly different from what people are used to or that require a significant investment of time or money.

One of the main reasons people may be hesitant to try new products and services is the fear of the unknown. People are often more comfortable sticking with what they know and trust, rather than taking a risk on something new. This can be especially true if the new product or service is complex or unfamiliar, or if it requires a significant commitment of time or money. In these cases, people may be worried that they won't be able to use the product or service effectively, or that it won't live up to their expectations.

Another reason people may be hesitant to try new products and services is the fear of failure. Nobody wants to make a mistake or have a negative experience, and trying something new carries the risk of both. This can be especially true if the product or service is expensive or difficult to use, as people may be worried that they won't be able to get their money's worth or that they will struggle to make it work.

Finally, people may be hesitant to try new products and services because of the fear of being judged. In today's connected world, it's easier than ever for people to share their experiences and opinions about products and services with others. This can make people hesitant to try something new, as they may be worried about being judged by their friends, family, or social media followers if they have a negative experience.

When building new products and services, it's important to consider these potential sources of hesitation and try to address them. Here are a few things to consider:

Make sure the product or service is easy to understand and use. If people are intimidated by the complexity of a product or service, they are less likely to try it.
Provide clear and accurate information about the product or service, including how it works and what it can do. This can help people understand what they are getting and make an informed decision.
Offer a money-back guarantee or some other form of assurance. This can help people feel more comfortable trying the product or service, as they know they can get their money back if they are not satisfied.
Get feedback from people who have tried the product or service, and use this feedback to improve it. This can help build trust and confidence in the product or service, as people see that others have had positive experiences with it.
Be transparent and honest about any potential drawbacks or limitations of the product or service. This can help people make more realistic expectations and avoid disappointment.
Overall, building new products and services is always a challenge, but by considering the potential sources of hesitation and taking steps to address them, you can make it more likely that people will be willing to try them.

People are often hesitant to try new products and services for a variety of reasons. Some may be unsure of the quality of the product or service, while others may be concerned about the potential risks or costs associated with trying something new. In order to build successful products and services, it is important to consider the following factors:

Trust: People are more likely to try new products and services if they trust the brand or company behind them. This can be established through word-of-mouth recommendations from friends and family, or through a company's reputation and track record.

Value: People are more likely to try new products and services if they perceive them to offer value. This can be in the form of a tangible benefit (such as improved performance or convenience), or a more intangible benefit (such as increased happiness or fulfillment).

Risk: People may be hesitant to try new products and services if they perceive them to be risky. This can be in the form of financial risk (such as a high price tag), or physical risk (such as the potential for injury or harm).

Compatibility: People are more likely to try new products and services if they are compatible with their existing lifestyle and habits. This can be in the form of compatibility with other products or services they already use, or compatibility with their personal values and beliefs.

Convenience: People are more likely to try new products and services if they are convenient to use. This can be in the form of easy access (such as online availability), or ease of use (such as simple instructions or user-friendly design).

Social acceptance: People are more likely to try new products and services if they are socially accepted or endorsed by others. This can be in the form of endorsements from influencers or celebrities, or through positive reviews and testimonials from other users.

Customization: People are more likely to try new products and services if they can be customized to fit their individual needs and preferences. This can be in the form of customizable options (such as different sizes or colors), or personalized recommendations based on their previous purchases or interests.

Support: People are more likely to try new products and services if they know they will have support available if they need it. This can be in the form of customer service, technical support, or access to helpful resources such as FAQs or user manuals.

Transparency: People are more likely to try new products and services if the company behind them is transparent about their practices and policies. This can be in the form of clear and concise information about the product or service, as well as open and honest communication with customers.

Flexibility: People are more likely to try new products and services if they are flexible and adaptable. This can be in the form of flexible payment options, or the ability to easily return or exchange the product if it doesn't meet their expectations.

By considering these factors and incorporating them into the design and development of new products and services, companies can help overcome the hesitation of potential customers and increase the likelihood of successful adoption.

When it comes to adopting new digital products and services, many people may feel hesitant or unsure about making the leap. This hesitation can be caused by a variety of factors, including concerns about security, privacy, compatibility, and the overall reliability of the product or service.

Here are 15 unique points to consider when creating new digital products and services, in order to address and overcome any potential hesitation among users:

Security: One of the biggest concerns for many people when it comes to adopting new digital products and services is the issue of security.

People want to know that their personal information and data will be kept private, and not shared or sold without their consent. To address this concern, make sure to have clear and concise privacy policies in place, and ensure that users understand what data is being collected and how it will be used.

Compatibility: Another potential barrier to adoption of new digital products and services is the issue of compatibility. Users want to know that the product or service will work seamlessly with their existing devices, operating systems, and software. To address this concern, make sure to thoroughly test the product or service across a range of different devices and platforms, and provide clear and concise instructions for users on how to set up and use the product or service.

Reliability: When it comes to new digital products and services, users want to know that they can rely on them to work as expected, without any issues or downtime.

Customer support: When it comes to new digital products and services, users want to know that they will have access to support and assistance if they encounter any issues or challenges. To address this concern, make sure to have a dedicated customer support team in place, and provide clear and concise instructions on how users can reach out for help if they need it.

Pricing: For many users, the price of a new digital product or service can be a major factor in their decision to adopt it. If a product or service is too expensive, users may be hesitant to invest in it. To address this concern, make sure to offer a range of pricing options, including free or trial versions, to give users the opportunity to try out the product or service before committing to a purchase.

Trustworthiness: When it comes to new digital products and services, users want to know that they can trust the company behind the product or service.
