One of my favourite thought experiements is to imagine what society might have been like had there been a small change to our biology. 

the biology change thought experiment:

What small change in our biology would have huge effects on our society? 

The human body is a complex and intricate system, with each part playing a crucial role in our overall functioning. A small change in our biology, therefore, can have significant effects on our society.

One potential small change in our biology could be a mutation in the gene that controls hunger. This could result in individuals feeling full after eating smaller portions of food, leading to weight loss and improved health outcomes. This would have a huge impact on obesity rates and related health issues in our society.

If we had evolved to feel full after eating smaller portions of food, society would be vastly different in a number of ways. For starters, the prevalence of obesity and related health issues would likely be much lower. With smaller portion sizes, individuals would be less likely to consume excess calories and gain weight. This could lead to a healthier population, with fewer instances of chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease.

Additionally, smaller portion sizes would likely lead to a more sustainable food system. With less food waste and lower demand for caloric intake, there would be less strain on resources like water and land. This could result in a more environmentally-friendly society, with less strain on our planet's resources.

Furthermore, smaller portion sizes could potentially lead to a change in societal norms and cultural attitudes towards food. With less emphasis on large meals and more focus on balanced, healthy eating, there could be a shift towards a more mindful and conscious approach to food consumption. This could lead to a more mindful and healthy society overall.

In conclusion, if we had evolved to feel full after eating smaller portions of food, society would likely be healthier, more sustainable, and more mindful of their food consumption habits.
