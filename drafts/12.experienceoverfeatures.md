### I'd bet that on the whole, experience win over features

But of course, for startups, your product is often the key to success. It’s your way to disrupt incumbents and find opportunities for growth.


>Based on an aggregation of anonymized product usage data, Pendo determined that
80 percent of features in the average software product are rarely or never used.
Publicly-traded cloud software companies collectively invested up to $29.5 billion
developing these features, dollars that could have been spent on higher value features
and unrealized customer value.


This is why having a product-driven culture can be so critical.

“An inherent challenge in B2B is we serve two customers – the buyer vs end user,” said Clara Shih, who is the CEO and founder of Hearsay Systems. “Buyers often think they know what end users want, but sometimes they miss the mark. Looking at product usage analytics is only part of the story. What's been game-changing for us at Hearsay Systems is having everyone in the company spend time with our end users -- insurance agents and financial advisors -- to first understand the ‘why’ and ‘jobs to be done.’ Especially as a vertical industry-focused company, we can go deep and the usage issues resolve themselves.”
