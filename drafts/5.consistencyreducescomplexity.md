#### Reflections on where consistency might help in reducing unnecessary complexity

We have to make many decisions everyday. Some of these deserve the right to take up a lot of mental capacity, others not so.

Here are a couple of reflections on some small experiments that I've previously taken in using consistency to reduce complexity in choice.

#### What to buy to drink
Specifically I'm referring to teas, coffees and the like. You

#### What to wear
Specifically I'm referring to teas, coffees and the like. You

#### What to eat
Specifically I'm referring to teas, coffees and the like. You

#### What to listen to
Specifically I'm referring to teas, coffees and the like. You

#### What to invest in
Specifically I'm referring to teas, coffees and the like. You 

If you have any more experiments that could be run [let me know](/contact) I'd be interested in comparing notes.
