Research in-market
Advice on research by visiting your target market

In-market research is a valuable way to make contacts and get specific, tailored information about potential markets.

Be prepared to spend more time and money on this type of analysis. It’s best carried out after you’ve conducted online research, and gathered all the relevant information you can in the UK.

You should focus on:

making trusted connections in the market
assessing competitor activity in your chosen country
noting customer behaviour, motivations and preferences
finding the best ways to bring your product or service to market
Attend in-country exhibitions or events
Attending an overseas trade show, fair or exhibition is a good way to:

meet potential customers and network
find agents or distributors
market your product or service to an interested audience
assess demand for your product or service
research a new market
find out about local competitors
Find trade shows for your sector:

on the DIT events site
in internet directories and databases
by asking your trade association
You may be able to get a grant to attend overseas trade shows through the Tradeshow Access Programme. Find out more about visiting the market and attending trade shows

Overseas Market Introduction Services (OMIS)
OMIS is a chargeable service offered by the Department for International Trade, which can help with your export market research. See the OMIS section in research markets online for more information.

Appoint an agency to research in-market
Appointing a market research agency can be expensive but their results should be thorough and objective. Select one you trust and brief them well. Make sure their proposal includes:

what they’re researching and how
a breakdown of costs and expenses
timescales and the report format
a confidentiality agreement
