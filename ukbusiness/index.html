      <h3 class="title">1. What does it mean to be a business in the UK?</h3>
      <blockquote class="nutshell">
        <p>
          <b>In summary:</b> A business is a legally recognised unit producing goods or services and usually paying taxes. They are categorised by a series of defined codes. Business statistics make use of a register, referenced as
          <em>enterprises</em> or they are <em>estimated</em>, this is because some are too small to be registered.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Being a business first invovles a type of registration or formation. There are three common ways people go about doing this in the UK:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals can do business by registering as a <em>sole trader</em>.</li>
        <li>Individuals or groups can incorporate a <em>company</em>.</li>
        <li>Groups can come together and register as a <em>partnership</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are lots more business structures available. People choose a structure that works best how they plan to operate, how many people are responsible and other considerations.</p>
      <p>Due to the variety of ways a business can operate and the need for alignment to the same concepts, the core sets of UK statistics use a list called the Inter-Departmental Business Register (<a
          href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/paidservices/interdepartmentalbusinessregisteridbr">IDBR</a>) to <em>analyse</em> businesses as a whole.</p>
      <p>When using data that uses the IDBR in particular and refering to a single business in the UK, we are actually
        refering to an <em>enterprise unit</em>.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2019" class="shadow">
        <p>
          The term ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is used to represent an enterprise. An enterprise can be defined as the smallest combination of legal units (generally based on VAT and/or PAYE records) that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which
          benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of its current resources. <a
            href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2019">via ONS</a>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>However businesses can be so small that the register may not include them, which is where we can make use of another data set called the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">Business
          Population Estimates</a> (BPE):</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019" class="shadow ">
        <p>[As] there is no single database in the UK which contains details of every active
          business. The [BPE] takes data on businesses on the IDBR, and then <em>estimates the number of additional very small businesses
            unregistered for VAT or PAYE</em> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/836574/METHODOLOGY___QUALITY_NOTE_BPE.pdf">via BEIS</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So we can use <em>both</em> these data sets to get a general picture of what's happening in the UK. For more on the differences <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/guide-to-business-statistics">this guide</a> offers a good overview. More on the data used is available <a href="data.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Next, we also need to consider Standard Industrial Classifications or (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">SIC codes</a>). Just like
        the variety of structures there are a large number of things a business can do to meet the needs of it's customers. So to capture what businesses typically do, SIC codes are used to classify economic activites.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007" class="shadow ">
        <p>A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the UK in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged.<a

      <p>These activities are organised into <em>classes or subclasses</em>, <em>groups</em>, <em>divisions</em>, <em>sections</em> and <em>broad industry groups (BIG)</em>. The chart below provides an outline of the breakdown with the number of each

        development, professional services and more. Here's another example using a popular UK super market store:</p>

      <p>On the whole the visual trend appears to be that survival rates could be linked to the density of both people and other businesses. London is interesting to compare to the other regions as the highest in buisness count and population. Whilst
        we can see that the business numbers are large it has a very low survival rate in comparison to other
        regions. Perhaps a cumulation of density, population numbers and rent costs of the region could be attributed.</p>
      <p>In the chart below we are repeating the main points but swapping the regional population with the Median gross annual earnings of full time employees for that region.</p>
